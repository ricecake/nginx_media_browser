# nginx_media_browser
A media browser for static nginx media

This is primarially meant to be used to browse media files available via nginx, without needing the overhead of a dedicated media server.

It relies heavily on the nginx autoindex functionality, and assumes that your media is able to be played by standard html5 video elements.
